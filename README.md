# WALLABY notebooks

Template Jupyter notebooks for WALLABY team members to access internally released WALLABY data. This repository contains the following:

* `user_science.ipynb` - access to WALLABY data through astropy tables for data analysis.
* `user_download.ipynb` - download catalog tables and products as `.fits` files.

## Access

WALLABY users can use the TAP service at https://wallaby.aussrc.org/tap to interact with data using their preferred tools (e.g. TOPCAT).
The notebooks provide an alternative interface to those who are more familiar with Python (science notebook), or to those who prefer to download files and work with them locally (download notebook). Instructions for data access are available in the notebooks.

## Authentication

To access the data you will need to sign up for an account with the AusSRC. For those who do not have an account, please email [Lachlan Campbell](mailto:lachlan.campbell@csiro.au) or [Hasan Rayan](hasan.rayan@csiro.au) and request an account.

Once you have an account, you will first need to log in to the [WALLABY portal](https://wallaby.aussrc.org). This is to sync authentication details from Keycloak with the WALLABY database. You will then use these credentials in the notebooks in the relevant sections to download data.

## Support
